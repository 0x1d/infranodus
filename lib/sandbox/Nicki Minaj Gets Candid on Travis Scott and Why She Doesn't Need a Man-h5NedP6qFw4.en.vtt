00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.009
First of all, congratulations.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.221
This is number one
in 86 countries.

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:04.720
Yes.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.430
Now, when you were number
two behind Travis Scott,

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.382
it seemed you got
upset about that.

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:20.590
But why do people say things
like "upset" or "angry"?

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.256
When someone says how
they feel, they're

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.530
not always upset or angry.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.845
Well what were you feeling?

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:27.094
I felt like I wanted to punch
him in his [BLEEP] face.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.520
Because--

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.950
What are those emotions
then if that's not anger?

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.460
No, no.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.390
It's not anger.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.640
It's just what's right
and what's wrong.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.850
What's fair.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.634
I've had a number two
album, and I never cared.

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.050
It's just that when you have
a number two to someone who's

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.930
selling shirts and
merch and selling passes

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.060
for a tour that's not
even announced yet,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.569
it feels like you're
being tricked.

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.110
It feels like, you know, someone
is playing a game and, like,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.630
beating you at a game as
opposed to just selling music.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.781
I want to sell music.

00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.280
Right.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.760
So you're saying that's
what he was doing?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.310
Yes.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.810
Yes.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.990
He sold a lot of
t-shirts and sweaters.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.810
And tour passes.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.670
And so we're not
going to have that.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.620
OK.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.450
All right.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.426
Yes.

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:15.790
So he didn't-- so I wanna say,
he didn't have the number one

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.290
album.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.200
Queen was the number one album.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.080
And by the way, I lost
out on 12 hours of sales

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.132
in my first week, because
it was a secret album.

00:01:24.132 --> 00:01:26.340
So I was going to drop it
while I was on Queen radio.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.210
And then I did it.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.710
And then 12 hours
later it came out.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.850
So to even have that much
to do such a huge number

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.840
is a big deal.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.491
So I want to make
sure I say this.

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.740
Because sometimes people
think that you're ungrateful.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.000
And I'm, like, the most
grateful person in the world.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.330
I love being grateful
and remembering

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.600
that things could be worse.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.100
OK?

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.300
I started from nothing.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.830
I'm one of those people who--

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.880
I get it.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.830
But I don't like being bullied.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.870
And I don't like being
taken advantage of.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.240
And sometimes people use
scare tactics against you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.310
because they know,
especially as a black woman,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.887
that people will call
you angry or bitter.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:01.470
And so now, it's
almost like we're not

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.940
allowed to defend ourselves
or stand up for ourselves.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.357
And I'm not going to have that.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:05.940
Don't have it.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.440
No.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.884
No.

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:09.828
You are not gonna have it.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:10.786
No.

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:11.286
Good.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.050
All right.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.730
Let's talk about your love life.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.420
Why?

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.650
Because.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.382
Last time I got it out of you
that you were with Nas, and I--

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:23.090
No, I didn't say I
wasn't I was with Nas.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.770
I said I chilled--

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.030
I hung out with him.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.120
All right.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.620
All right.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.270
So you hung out with Nas.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.770
And he and I are
still good friends.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.269
Good.

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.480
Meek Mill you hung out with.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.670
You hung out with Drake.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.090
No I-- no, no, no.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.610
All right.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.110
No.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.690
I was in a relationship
with Meek for a while.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.290
But not Drake?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.510
And it was very toxic something.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.650
But we had some good times.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.910
And we ended that.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.890
And then, no, with Drake, I've
never been in a relationship

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.390
with Drake.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.630
No?

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.200
OK.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.840
Whose new boy?

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.970
There is new boy, right?

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.370
Hmm.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.640
I have my people.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.140
I know.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.280
How do you know?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.510
How do you get these--

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.610
I'm know who's giving it.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.300
I know he's giving this
information to you, Ellen.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.341
I don't even talk to him.

00:03:04.341 --> 00:03:04.920
Whatever.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.230
No.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.200
Well, there was--
there is a new boy,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.770
but he and I kind of like
fell back a little bit.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.300
And then, [LAUGHING] and
then there's, like, a newer--

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.310
Oh, but there's a new boy.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.160
So there's a newer new boy?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.060
Yeah.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.430
How new is this new boy?

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.530
Fairly new.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.790
Like, as long as the
hair's been on your leg?

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.170
No.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.010
He's been around for
a couple of weeks now.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.805
All right.

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:34.900
But I don't--

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.920
I don't have a boy.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.360
Look, I'm just chilling.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.919
I've always been in a
relationship my whole life.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.960
I was in a relationship
since I was 15 years old.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.584
This is the first
time that I'm single.

00:03:43.584 --> 00:03:44.260
And I'm happier.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.180
I'm more free.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.440
And that's OK.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.420
Good.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.850
All right.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.180
I used to feel like
I had to have a man.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.900
I swear.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
My whole adult life.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.566
I used to feel like
I had to have a man.

00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:59.390
And I want every woman on here
to know, you absolutely don't.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.930
You can go--

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.950
Amen, sister.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.730
I want women to know also,
you don't need a man.
